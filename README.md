This repository is a framework for building a digital version of the popular board game. :game_die:

Here are some notes:

* I rewrote the Random object to give a random word from a list.  You can change the word list by passing a different file to the constructor.
* The resources folder contains a couple interesting word lists, including the original list.
* The Game.java file starts by drawing a sample board.  Of course it doesn't store the random words it selects....perhaps use an array :grin:

You may change any code you like, this is just is jumping off point.  Good luck! :+1:
